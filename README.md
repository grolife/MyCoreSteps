# MyCoreSteps
A project to track your core steps that one should do on daily basis.

Let's say there are 3 or 9 things you want to do on a daily basis.

As an entrepreneur, if 212 is your mantra - 2 contacts a day, 1 hour reading, 2 talks to listen or watch.
This project will help you track your daily progress. You can check as you complete each task. At the end of the month, you will see how consistent you were in your 212 tracking. 

You will find how close you are to your goals and in what areas you need to consciously put more effort.
